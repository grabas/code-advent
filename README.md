# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, implemented in Python.

## Description

Who needs chocolate when you've got code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an annual December event where each day is a new conundrum to crack.
Forget silent nights; this is about late-night coding sessions.
This repo is a collection of my solutions to these challenges.

Merry Christmas! üéÑüë®‚ÄçüíªüéÖ 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Project

To initialize the project on your local machine, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/grabas/code-advent.git path/to/code-advent
$ python -m venv path/to/code-advent
$ mkdir path/to/code-advent/src/resources
$ cd path/to/code-advent
$ source path/to/code-advent/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific day of the challenge, containing the solution and input files. To run a solution, navigate to the day's directory and execute the Python script.

Since the input files are different for each caroler, you will need to replace the contents of the input files located in /src/resources/*.txt with your own. You can find your input files on each day's challenge page.

For example:
```bash
$ python path/to/code-advent/src/day_01/1_1.py
$ python path/to/code-advent/src/day_01/1_2.py
```

## Contributing
